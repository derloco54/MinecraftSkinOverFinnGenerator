# MinecraftSkinOverFinnGenerator
Generates a pak file to be used as a mod for the character Finn on Multiversus

To install the mod copy the pak file into gameInstall/MultiVersus/Content/Paks/~mods(if ~mods does not exist create it)

You will need blender and unreal engine(4.26) to make and generate mods for Multiversus.
